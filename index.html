<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the page for the behavior referral tracker. This is a three file system that will help teachers and other staff input referrals more quickly
  and allow administrators to view referrals in a timely fashion and assign cases to counselors. This system allows for the loop to be closed on referrals.
  Far too often teachers submit a referral to never know what came of it. With the optional teacher trackers teachers can recieve follow-up notifications.</p>

<p> Without the teacher tracking pages this system allows for administrators and counselors to be in communication regarding open cases and
  for administrators to learn what the resolution of closed cases were. This also feeds all data into a Google Data Studio file that allows coaches,
  teachers, administrators, and the PBIS team to look at behavior data through the use of 13 filters. Using these data you can learn a lot about what
  is happening in your school. </p>

  <p> To support your work in using this new tracking system I have created a wiki file with instructions for use as well as a series of 5 videos.
    Those of you that will be using only the front-end of this (the referral entry and charts) will only want to watch the first 2 videos. Those
    that are working with the back-end of the files (setting it all up) will want to watch all of the video and read the instructions. Most of this is
    set up to work without much fuss, however you will need to make a few adjustments. </p>

    <p> Please feel free to contact me if you have ANY needs at my email, twitter, or any other method listed here. Please feel free to share this, it is
      free to use but please remember to give me credit!</p>
